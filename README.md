# asserts
commom resources for some my reposities, include point clouds, images and so on. All of them are binary file. And I will clear log from time to time to limit size of git. So log and commit isn't reliable.

### point cloud
1. Tools to visualize, crop and move cloud are provided. 
2. I generated a preview image for some clouds. 
3. All clouds will be stored as `.pcd` format.
4. Here are cloud from different conditions, such as fog, dust, rain and so on.

I use `plc_visualizer` to display cloud from pcd files. You should change folder that contains files by yourself. You can use my visualizer exe(default). If you want to change something to visualizer window, I provide code and you can do it by yourself.
```bash
python3 pclv.py
```
